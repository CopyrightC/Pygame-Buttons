# Pygame-Buttons

Wait pygame doesn't have buttons? No problem.
Use this repository and save your self for writing 30+ lines just for a button!

# How do I import this file?
Open up your terminal and execute the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/SATAN01/Pygame-Buttons
cd Pygame-Buttons (Optional)
python example.py  (Optional; You run this to see the example button) 
```
Now in your `foo.py` file import it like this:

```
from pg_button import Button
```

Note your folder structure should look something like :
```
/foo
  /bar
    /Pygame-Buttons
    /your_file.py
    /foobar -> Optional
```
