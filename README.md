# Pygame-Buttons

Wait pygame doesn't have buttons? No problem.
Use this repository and save your self for writing 30+ lines just for a button!

# How do I import this file?
Open up your terminal and execute the following commands
```
git clone https://github.com/SATAN01/Pygame-Buttons
cd Pygame-Buttons
```
So your folder structure should look something like :
```
/foo
  /bar
    /Pygame-Buttons
    /your_file.py
    /foobar
```
Now in `your_file.py` you can simply import Buttons like this

from pygame_buttons import Button
# How do I use this?

Refer `example.py`
